        <p> Barbara Liskov (November 7th, 1939), is an American computer scientist. She currently teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She was the first woman to ever have been granted a doctorate in computer science in the US. She is also a Turing Award[1] winner. That is quite the achievement! </p>
        <p> She became interested in computers and programming when she moved to Boston and began working at Mitre Corporation. After a year there, Barbara took a programming job at Harvard where she worked on language translation. She enjoyed it so much that she decided to go back to school, and graduated from Stanford University with a P.h.D. The topic of her thesis was a computer program to play chess, and for that she developed the killer heuristics.</p>
        <p> After that she returned to Mitre to work as a researcher.
            Then in 1971, shortly after her experiments with Venus and presenting her paper on the topic, she was invited for a position at MIT. Liskov left Mitre and joined the MIT faculty as a professor in Computer Science.</p>
        <p> She worked on many major projects, including the design and implementation of CLU/Argus, the first high-level language to support implementation of distributed programs and to demonstrate the technique of promise pipelining.</p>
        <p> Liskov's subsequent work has mainly been in the area of distributed systems, which use several computers connected by a network. Her research has covered many aspects of operating systems and computation, including important work on object-oriented database systems, garbage collection, caching, persistence, recovery, fault tolerance, security, decentralized information flow, modular upgrading of distributed systems, geographic routing, and practical Byzantine fault tolerance.</p>
        <p>[1] The ACM A. M. Turing Award is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for contributions "of lasting and major technical importance to the computer field".</p>
