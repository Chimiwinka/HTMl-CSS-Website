    <p>This was the first ever module i had for this course, and although it felt rushed at first, mainly because this was also the first time I ever properly learned about these things, I feel more assured now that I can succeed with the rest of the course. </p>
    <p>I was taught the fundamentals of HTML and CSS programming, as well as computation and problem-solving ( computational thinking). I have learned other concepts regarding data-structure and algorithms, etc, and I cannot wait to use this knowledge for the next modules to come.  </p>
    <p>I learned to create a website and structure it using VScode, and that was very fun and interesting. I also had the chance to know more about computer science when I was looking for pioneers for my assignment. I ended up choosing Barbara Liskov, but there were many others with very interesting and mind-blowing work. </p>
    <p> I feel more prepared for the work that is coming throughout this year and confident I will succeed. </p>
    <p>Thank you! </p>
