      <p> My name is Chris and I'm currently doing  my masters on Computing and iT Management. I came to this course not being sure what to expect, or whether it was the right choice.
        Part of my assignment was to create this website, so please enjoy. And be kind! </p>
      <p> First thing I will be talking about is Computational Thinking, as it is something we have talked about and need to apply throughout the course. </p>
      <p> Overall in education, computational thinking (CT) is a set of problem-solving methods that involve expressing problems and their solutions in ways that a computer could execute. This can lie hand in hand with programming, which consists in writing a set of clear instructions in order for a computer to perform a task. </p>
      <p> Now you might think that these machines are very smart (in a way), but I can tell you from what I have learned so far, that they absolutely are not! You need to input clear and precise instructions, otherwise it cannot understand anything and..."beep boop beep"..., it will fail (fun fact i discovered, "beep boop beep" means "I love you" in binary code).
        These instructions are usually written in a programming language known as code. And to do this, you'll need to understand the core of programming, what can be done, how and why do it that way. </p>
      <p> I cannot go into too much detail because I am still learning, and if you are reading this, you probably know way more than me, but there are a series of challenges that a novice programmer (me) has to overcome when learning to program. If you are in the same position as me, then my advice for you is to practice - it will become easier to understand the more you do it, and the fluidity of your thought-process will also improve. You can do it alone, or with friends/colleagues. Talking about it (code) and sharing experiences and knowledge will help everyone understand it better. You also have the entire World Wide Web to explore, and it's full of resources, use them.
      </p>
      <p>Good Luck! </p>
